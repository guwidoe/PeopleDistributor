A sophisticated Rust-based solution for optimally distributing people into groups across multiple sessions to maximize social interactions while respecting various constraints. Now featuring **GroupMixer**, a modern web application that makes group optimization accessible to everyone.

## üåü Try GroupMixer

**GroupMixer** is a user-friendly web application built on top of the GroupMixer engine. Perfect for conferences, workshops, team building, and any event where you need to create optimal group assignments.

üöÄ **[Try GroupMixer Now](https://groupmixer.app)** - No installation required, runs entirely in your browser!

## Overview

GroupMixer solves the social group scheduling problem using advanced optimization algorithms. It distributes a given number of people into groups across multiple sessions, maximizing the number of unique contacts while respecting various hard and soft constraints.

## Architecture

The project is organized as a Rust workspace with four main components:

### üß† `solver-core` - Core Optimization Engine

The heart of the system, providing:

- **Simulated Annealing** algorithm for optimization
- **Flexible constraint system** supporting:
  - Repeat encounter limits (with configurable penalty functions)
  - Attribute balance constraints (e.g., gender distribution)
  - Immovable person assignments
  - Must-stay-together constraints
  - Cannot-be-together constraints
- **Comprehensive scoring system** with detailed breakdowns
- **Configurable stop conditions** (time limits, iteration limits, improvement thresholds)
- **Extensive test suite** with data-driven tests

### üåê `webapp` - GroupMixer Web Application

A modern, full-featured React application that provides:

- **Intuitive web interface** for problem setup and visualization
- **React 19 + TypeScript** with Vite for fast development

## Quick Start

### üéØ Using GroupMixer (Recommended)

The easiest way to get started is with the web application:

1. **Visit the deployed app** at [GroupMixer](https://groupmixer.app)
2. **Try a demo case** from the dropdown to see the tool in action
3. **Create your own problem** by defining people, groups, and constraints
4. **Run the solver** and view optimized results
5. **Export schedules** in CSV or JSON format

### üíª Running Locally

To run the webapp locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GroupMixer.git
cd GroupMixer

# Build and run the webapp
cd webapp
npm install
npm run dev
```

The webapp will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### üîß Using the Web Server

1. **Start the server:**

   ```bash
   cd solver-server
   cargo run
   ```

2. **Submit a job via HTTP POST to `http://localhost:3000/solve`:**
   ```json
   {
     "problem": {
       "people": [
         { "id": "Alice", "attributes": { "gender": "female" } },
         { "id": "Bob", "attributes": { "gender": "male" } }
       ],
       "groups": [{ "id": "Group1", "size": 2 }],
       "num_sessions": 3
     },
     "constraints": [
       {
         "type": "RepeatEncounter",
         "max_allowed_encounters": 1,
         "penalty_function": "squared",
         "penalty_weight": 100.0
       }

```

This builds both the WebAssembly module and the React application.

You can also rebuild just the wasm by using

```bash
cd webapp
npm run build-wasm
```

### Building Individual Components

```bash
# Core solver library
cd solver-core
cargo build --release

# WebAssembly module
cd solver-wasm
wasm-pack build --target no-modules

# HTTP server
cd solver-server
cargo run
```

## Testing

cargo test --test data_driven_tests

# Run benchmarks
cargo test --test data_driven_tests -- --ignored

- Basic functionality
- Constraint handling
- Performance benchmarks
- Edge cases and stress tests
- Comparison with Google CP-SAT solver

## Deployment

The webapp is configured for easy deployment on Vercel:

```bash

The build process automatically:

1. Installs Rust toolchain
2. Builds the WebAssembly module
3. Compiles TypeScript
4. Creates optimized production bundle

- **Legacy C++ implementation** (`legacy_cpp/`)
- **Legacy Rust implementation** (`legacy_rust/`)
- **Python Google CP-SAT solver** (`python/`) for comparison
